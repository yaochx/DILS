# DILS
Depth Image Layers Separation Algorithm
## introduction
Depth Image Layers Separation (DILS) algorithm is used to postprocess disparity map obtained from stereo vision.  
The approach is to separate the depth map into several layers identified through histogram-based clustering. Each layer is extracted using interview interpolation to create objects based on location and depth.
